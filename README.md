## Linear Regression

This project aimed to develop a robust predictive model capable of accurately estimating trip prices based on various factors. By leveraging Linear Regression and meticulously analyzing relevant variables, I successfully constructed a predictive framework that explained approximately 92% of the variance in trip prices. This achievement not only demonstrated my proficiency in regression analysis but also highlighted my ability to deliver accurate predictive models, essential for optimizing pricing strategies and enhancing user experience in the ride-hailing industry.
